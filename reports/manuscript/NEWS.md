+ Finish first complete version of Introduction and Discussion
+ Sent to Peter for comments.





## 0.7.1



+ Use costs versions for now. The contribution of including costs still needs to be discussed
+ Revised all sections
+ Note: log-transforming the population density data raster to create a cost raster is probably not a realistic thing. Now the following holds

```R
        pop_density_v5
Min.          0.000000
1st Qu.       0.000000
Median        2.397895
3rd Qu.       3.295837
Max.         10.222014
NA's          0.000000
```

+ The cost effect is hence very low

### Category: 3. Biodiversity Research and Reviews  



### Preparing the manuscript

+ This is the core section of the journal and presents research or review articles **up to 5000 words** in length, but preferably shorter (the word limit refers to text from the start of the introduction to the end of the acknowledgements - i.e. excluding the title, abstract, references, figure captions, and tables). 
+ The Editor reserves the right to publish long tables and appendices on the journal’s website, rather than in the printed version. Such a decision will only be taken after consultation with the author. 
+ A **short running title** should be provided. 
+ The manuscript must include an abstract of **no more than 300 words** structured under the headings: Aim, Location, Methods, Results, Main conclusions, and ending with a list of 6-10 keywords or phrases, arranged in alphabetical order. 
+ Three different weights of headings are available: **authors should indicate the relative importance of a heading** by the use of ringed capital letters. i.e. (A) for main headings; (B) for secondary headings; and, (C) for tertiary headings. 
+ A biosketch entry should be included after the references section (see below).



#### Formatting your Manuscript

The essential points of Diversity and Distribution’s format are summarized below. Please consult a recent volume of the journal for details and examples.


**1.**  ***General*** - Please use line numbering.


**2.**  ***Title page*** - *DDI* papers should begin with a title page that includes:

- The title

- The names of all authors

- The postal addresses and email addresses of the authors

- A list of 6-10 keywords

- A short running-title

- The name of corresponding author

  The number of words in the Abstract

- The number of words in main body of the paper, from the Introduction through the Biosketch (see below)

- The number of references

- ​

**3.**  ***Sections*** - The sections of the paper should be presented in the following order: 

	1. Introduction
	2. Methods
	3. Results
	4. Discussion
	5. Acknowledgements
	6. List of brief titles of items in the supplementary material
	7. Biosketch
	8. References
	9. Appendices containing references to data sources (see below)
	10. Tables
	11. Figure Legends
	12. Figures, Supporting Information (i.e., appendices to be published online).


**4.**  **A *Biosketch*** should be included: a short (30-100 words for one author, or up to 150 words for three authors) description of the research interests of the author(s). For papers with >3 authors, a biosketch should either focus on first author, or should be a general statement of the focus of the research team. Links to authors' web pages may be provided.


**5.**  ***Citations to data sources*** - Some studies (e.g., meta-analyses) use data drawn from multiple published sources. If these sources are not otherwise cited in the main text, they should be listed in one or more appendices with titles similar to the following: “Appendix 1 – Data sources”. These data appendices will be printed in the main paper (so that citation indexing services will capture them), but in a reduce font. The main text should cite Appendix 1 (e.g. “A list of the data sources is found in Appendix 1.”).


**6.**  ***Figures and tables*** - Every figure and table must have a legend that makes the display piece understandable without reference to the main text. *All acronyms and abbreviations used in the display piece must be defined in its legend*. A casual browser of the literature should be able to easily grasp the point of the display piece. *It is often worthwhile to add a sentence summarizing what conclusions the reader should draw from the display piece*.


**7.** The correct nomenclatural authorities for all taxa must be given on the first appearance in the text, in Tables, and in the captions to Figures, unless a general reference to a standard source is provided at an appropriate place in the manuscript. Genus names should not be abbreviated in figure captions and table headings.



**Conflict of Interest**
Authors must disclose any conflict of interest that might be perceived as affecting the objectivity of conclusions, even if the conflict is only apparent.

*Diversity and Distributions* is a member of and subscribes to the principles of the Committee on Publication Ethics.



**Abbreviations and units**
SI units (metre, kilogram, etc.) are essential. Statistics and measurements should be given in figures, i.e. 10mm, except where the number begins the paragraph. When the number does not refer to a unit of measurement, it is spelt out, except where the number is greater than 10. A list of preferred abbreviations and naming conventions is available [here](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)1472-4642/homepage/JBI-GEB-DDI_abbreviation_rules.doc).



**Tables** must be positioned on separate sheets, numbered consecutively (Table 1, Table 2, etc.) and grouped together after the References. Column headings should be brief: with units of measurement in parentheses. Tables should be typed as text, using 'tabs' (not spaces) to align columns. **The use of table editors should be avoided.** Do not use graphics software to create tables.



**Methods** - Please ensure that this section is entitled 'METHODS', and not 'MATERIALS AND METHODS'.



**Figures, Illustrations and Maps**
All illustrations (including photographs) are classified as figures and should be numbered consecutively (Fig. 1, Fig. 2, etc.), and grouped together after the Tables – **they should NOT be embedded in the text**.



**Upon your manuscript being accepted for publication, please supply separate files containing electronic versions of your figures (see File Formats, below)**. Please note that your paper will go through production more quickly if instructions on content and format are followed carefully. Each figure must have a legend that makes the material completely understandable. Legends should be presented separately from the figures, in a list at the end of the manuscript. Label multi-panel figures (a), (b), (c), etc., preferably in the upper left corner, and refer to them in the text as, for example, **Fig. 1(a)**. Please ensure that electronic artwork is prepared such that, after reduction to fit across one or two columns or two-thirds width (80 mm, 169 mm or 110 mm, respectively) as required, all lettering and symbols will be clear and easy to read, i.e. no labels should be too large or too small. Prepare figures such that, after reduction to print size, all lettering and symbols will be clear and easily read, and such that each figure makes effective use of space. Font size in figures should be 8 pt. To check this, fix the image size (for example, in Illustrator) to the required column width, and check the font size. Avoid using tints if possible; if they are essential to the understanding of the figure, try to make them coarse.


Maps that display area data and organism distribution at a continental, hemispheric, or world scale **must always use an equal-area map projection** (e.g. Mollweide or Aitoff's). Note especially that Mercator's projection is not acceptable for such data. **Please indicate the precise projection employed in the caption**. On these maps, the equatorial scale should be indicated, while scale information should be provided, **preferably as a scale bar within the figure**, for all maps of whatever size and area.


**File Formats:** After acceptance of your manuscript for publication, figure files should be supplied as follows. **Photographic figures** should be saved in tif format at 300 d.p.i. (or failing that in jpg format with low compression). **Line figures** should be saved as vector graphics (i.e. composed of lines, curves, points and fonts; not pixels) in eps or pdf format, or embedded as such in Word, as this enhances their display when published online. **Combination figures** (those composed of vector and pixel/raster elements) should also be saved in eps or pdf format where possible (or embedded as such in Word). If line figures and combination figures cannot be saved in vector graphics format, they should be saved in tif format at high resolution (i.e. 600 d.p.i.) (do not save them in jpg format). If you are unsure about the resolution of your tif files, please zoom in and check that fonts, curves and diagonal lines are smooth-edged and do not appear blocky when viewed at high magnification. **Note that line and combination figures supplied in tif format are downsampled for online publication and so authors should preferentially opt for vector graphic formats for these figure types** (full resolution tif files are used for print publication).
Charges apply for the reproduction of **colour figures in the hard copy of the journal**. So, if your paper contains colour figures, the Colour Work Agreement form (available here), which outlines the charges, must be completed by the corresponding author and sent to Wiley Blackwell at acceptance. If using a limited colour palette we ask that authors avoid using red with green as this is a common colour-blindness combination. **If you are not prepared to pay for colour in print, figures will be produced in colour in electronic versions of the paper, but black and white in the print copy.** For the convenience of readers, we ask that you design your colour artwork so that it can be understood as best as possible in greyscale. Note that the same figure file must be used for both the print and online versions (we do not accept differing colour and black-and-white versions of the same figure). Authors must complete the Colour Work Agreement form even if they opt for colour online/black and white in print. Articles received by Wiley Blackwell with colour work will not be published until the form has been received. Please send a scanned copy of the form to our production editor (jbi@wiley.com) for information and, if paying for colour, post the hard copy of the form to: Customer Services (OPI), John Wiley & Sons Ltd, European Distribution Centre, New Era Estate, Oldlands Way, Bognor Regis, West Sussex, PO22 9NQ.

**Appendices and Supporting Information**
Appendices may be provided for important primary data, which needs to be included in the paper. If, however, these data are very extensive, or if they are of only indirect relevance to the paper, they will normally be made available in an electronic form through the Journal’s web pages. Mention of the first supporting appendix, table or figure ,etc., in the text should be in the form 'see Appendix S1 in Supporting Information' [where 'S' indicates Supporting], subsequent mention should be in the form 'see Appendix S2'. Authors should then include a Supporting Information section after the References section, which should be in the following form (text in curly brackets is for completion by the author, see instructions below):

\--------------------------------------------
**Supporting Information**

Additional Supporting Information may be found in the online version of this article:
**Appendix S1** {Insert short legend to online Appendix S1}
**Figure S1** {Insert short legend to online Figure S1}
**Table S1** {Insert short legend to online Table S1}
As a service to our authors and readers, this journal provides supporting information supplied by the authors.  Such materials are peer-reviewed and may be re-organized for online delivery, but are not copy-edited or typeset. Technical support issues arising from supporting information (other than missing files) should be addressed to the authors.
\-------------------------------------------

For reasons of space, only **short titles** to Supporting Information should be given in this section; full titles (if different) can be given with the Supporting Information itself; full titles can include a fuller description of content, definition of abbreviations, etc. Supporting Information files are hosted by the Publisher in the format supplied by the author and are not copy-edited by the Publisher. **It is the responsibility of the author to supply Supporting Information in an appropriate file format and to ensure that it is accurate and correct. Authors should therefore prepare Supporting Information with the same rigour as their main paper, including adhesion to journal style (e.g. formatting of references)**. Supporting Information can be provided as separate files or as one combined file. Authors are discouraged from supplying very large files or files in non-standard file formats, both of which may reduce their use to the readership. Files should be prepared without line numbers or wide line spacing, and with all track-change edits accepted. Further information on Supporting Information is available [here](http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/bauthor/suppmat.asp).

At proof correction stage authors will be given access to their Supporting Information (via the web) and should check it for accuracy and updates. If changes are required corrected versions of the files received with the proof must be emailed to the Production Editor, with a brief description of the changes made. Supporting Information **must** **be checked alongside the main proof** and corrections for both returned to the Production Editor at the same time.



**Biosketch/Biosketches**
A short Biosketch/Biosketches entry (30-100 words for one author/150 words for the first three authors, respectively) describing the research interests of the author(s) should be provided. For papers with 4 or more authors, biosketch details should be supplied for the first author only; alternatively, a general statement of the focus of the research team (a link to a group web page is encouraged) should be provided, together with a statement of author roles, e.g. Author contributions: A.S. and K.J. conceived the ideas; K.J. and R.L.M. collected the data; R.L.M. and P.A.K. analysed the data; and A.S. and K.J. led the writing.



**References**
We recommend the use of a tool such as EndNote for reference management and formatting. Click [here](http://authorservices.wiley.com/jendnotes/Divers_Distrib.ens) to download the most up to date EndNote reference style for *Diversity and Distributions*. References should be made by giving the author’s name with the year of publication in parentheses. When reference is made to a work by three authors or more, only the first name and *et al*. should be given in the citation. All authors’ names should be listed in the reference itself. If several papers by the same author and from the same year are cited, a, b, c, etc., should be inserted after the year of publication. References must be listed in alphabetical order at the end of the paper in the following standard form:

Cox, C. B. & Moore, P. D. (1999) *Biogeography: an ecological and evolutionary approach*, 6th edn. Blackwell Science Ltd, Oxford.

May, R.M. (1994) The effects of spatial scale on ecological questions and answers. *Large-scale ecology and conservation biology* (ed. by P.J. Edwards, R.M. May and N.R. Webb), pp. 1-17. Blackwell Scientific Publications, Oxford.

### Introduction

+ Why are ESs relevant for BD conservation in general?
  + Trade-offs important
  + More studies are explicitly incorporating ESs into the analyses
+ What is spatial conservation prioritization (SCP)?
  + SCP-methods have been primarily developed for biodiversity
+ Multiple SCP methods are available
  + This is also reflected in what types of datasets are used
  + More data covering broad geographical ranges and species is becoming available (RS)
+ How is SP for ESs different?
  + What has already been done?
  + Why is application of SCP methods nevertheless useful?
+ Why can direct application of SCP methods to ESs create issues? (**MISSING**)
+ In this manuscript, we...




### Discussion

- While our objective here was not primarily to do a directly	policy-relevant prioritization, the results already as they are informative.
- The general priority rank patterns are generally explained and in line with...
  - Kukkala et al. (2016)
  - Schulp et al. (2014)
  - Mouchet et al. (2017)
- However, a truly useful prioritization would require accounting for several other factors. 



##### Method performance

+ We show that performance-wise, all methods are very similar
  + Only for ES, Zonation seemed to produce a more balanced solution. This is probably because more spatially aggregated distributional patterns in the BD features, and the higher number of features. In any case, the result is related to the iterative cell removal process
  + Previous studies (e.g. Albuquerque & Beier, 2015) have suggested similar performance for RWR and ZON (though with CAZ) and suggested that they are close to optimal. Here, we show similar results.
+ The practical aspect of the prioritization analysis are different too.
  + RWR: 
    + Easy to set up
    + Runtimes:
      + ALL: ~12 min, ES: 24 seconds, BD: 10 min 49 s
  + ZON:
    + Runtimes:
      + ALL: , ES:, BD: 
  + NOTE! All the above are heavily dependant on the implementation details. 
+ However, it is important to note that the prioritization analyses we have used are simple; For any real-life application several complicating factors would probably need to be included. 



##### Data group differences



##### Integrated prioritization of biodiversity conservation andecosystem services supply

+ Results would probably change a lot if ES flows and demands would be accounted for through e.g. connectivity (Kukkala & Moilanen, 2016).

#### New structure

+ Ecosystem services (ES) quantify many perceived benefits that nature provides for people. ES are intricately linked with biodiversity, which is in places on Earth threatened. 
  + The whole rationale behind ES can be understood as to help to understand and to promote and protect the living environment. Besides being an boundary object in the broad sense (Schröter et al. 2014), ESs have gained traction in as guiding decision-making on the spatial allocation and land use (REF) and management (REF).
  + So far, considerable amount of research has been done on the spatial mapping and characterization of ES. However, devoid of clearly defined objectives and a decision-making framework, the usefulness of ES is hard to assess.
  + Furthermore, how the spatial assessment of ESs and biodiversity (BD) features is and should be combined is not clear. Some authors consider biodiversity as just another ES, where others (minority) combine both in the same analysis. How the combination exactly is done, matters greatly both conceptually and methodologically. 
+ Several different decision-making  frameworks have been used in the spatial assessment of ES
  + The exact details vary, but most have at least the following components in them: 1) problem definition, 2) setting the objectives, 3) describing potential alternatives, 4) quantifying trade-offs, and 5) making decisions preferably accompanied by some form on monitoring.
    + Mustajoki & Marttunen specify the following features of environmental problems in particular:
      1. The systemic and complex nature of the impacts and ill-defined nature of the problems
      2. Multiple stakeholders having different objectives
      3. Geographical distribution of the impacts 
      4. Uncertainties related to, e.g., the cause-effect relations of the impacts
  + For practical applications, assessing the usefulness of either 1) the data or 2) the methods used for decision support depends greatly on the defined objectives. However, the validity of both can (and should) also be assessed in isolation. This information when combined, should be highly useful for decision-makers and planners.
  + Multi-criteria decision-analysis (MCDA) has proved to be one of the most popular frameworks for analyzing the spatial patterns of ESs.

    + Non-spatial and spatial MCDA
+ What is spatial conservation prioritization (SCP)?
  - SCP-methods have been primarily developed for biodiversity, often with strong background in spatial ecology
  - SCP can be understood as the technical assessment phase within a broad decision-making context
  - Multiple SCP methods are available
    - This is also reflected in what types of datasets are used
    - More data covering broad geographical ranges and species is becoming available (RS)
  - Complementarity-based methods: an improvement over simple scoring methods.
  - While prioritization based on distributional patterns can be useful, an operational prioritization needs to account for costs, condition and benefits (Evans et al. 2015)
  - Several authors to date have explored the implications of prioritizing areas (REF) and actions (REF) targeting both ESs and BD. 
+ How is SP for ESs different?
  - What has already been done?
  - Why is application of SCP methods nevertheless useful?
  - Why can direct application of SCP methods to ESs create issues? (**MISSING**)
+ So, what's the real issue here?
  + Spatial scoring of things disregards the relative distributions between features
  + The notion of complementarity may or may not be relevant for spatial prioritization of ES in particular. It is certainly relevant for BD.
  + The specific question we try to answer are:
    1. How does a simple scoring method perform against more advanced spatial prioritization methods?
    2. Does complementarity offer significant advances in terms of ES?
    3. What are the operative considerations of each method in combined spatial prioritization for ES and BD?
  + Here, we are going to...
    1. ... by constructing a realistic enough spatial prioritization (including a proxy for costs)
    2. ... by discussing the ramifications on a operational planning use


### Discussion



#### What do I actually want to say?



+ Questions posed in the introduction
  1. Comparison of three methods: RWR, ILP and ZON
  2. The assumptions needed to make in order to use the methods
     1. RWR conceptually similar to MCDA > connection to MCDA.
     2. Rarity/richness
  3. Discuss the method performance and offer guidance on how to use them
     1. I can list things, but I don't think the analyses are needed for that

##### Integrated prioritization of biodiversity conservation andecosystem services supply

+ It still remains unclear how exactly ecosystem services should best be incorporated into prioritization schemes that have been developed with biodiversity conservation in mind.

  + Ecosystem services require additional considerations (e.g. , human demand, and ), which can be considerably different to those of species.
    + The availability of alternative means of providing benefits supplied by services
    + Capacity to meet demand
    + The scale of, and site dependency in, the delivery of services
    + Connectivity (provision connectivity, ES flow, distributed ES provision) (Kukkala & Moilanen 2016)

+ Many prioritization methods designed with biodiversity features in mind give high emphasis on relative rarity of features. Furthermore, ways of accounting for spatial arrangement of features are predominantly done with the ecology of species mind (e.g. ecological connectivity).

+ Furthermore, asymptotic benefit-functions often used in SCP (Arponen et al., 2005; Wilson et al., 2009)⁠ are not suitable for all ecosystem services for which either linear or more complex relationships are more appropriate (Barbier et al., 2008; Luck et al., 2012)⁠. Emphasizing the relative importance of rare features over more common features (Moilanen et al., 2005; Williams et al., 1996)⁠ is another principle which may be more suitable for biodiversity rather than ecosystem services features.  

+  Trade-offs between ecosystem service provision and biodiversity conservation are most likely common, ***as we have shown***. It does not necessarily follow that priority areas for the provision of ecosystem services are automatically priority areas also for biodiversity (Anderson et al., 2009; Thomas et al., 2012).

##### Expanding from core outwards - the suitability of methods

+ Often, the tool is selected first and other considerations follow. In terms of selecting the suitable prioritization tool for the job, we recommend the following:
  1. Study the assumptions behind the tools you are about to use. Is it geared more towards species or ES?
  2. Embrace flexibility, but avoid complexity.
  3. Practical considerations: complexity, technical resources, data and time needed
+ Operationalizing ecosystem services requires institutional adaptation, case-specific tailoring of methods, and deliberation among practitioners and stakeholders (Rinne and Primmer, 2015)
+ Qualitative method comparison. Bagstad et al. (2013) provide a useful set of criteria against which methods and software tools can be assessed.
  1. The fit of the underlying assumption/concepts with topic and research question
  2. Quantification and uncertainty
  3. Time requirements
  4. Capacity for independent application
  5. Level of development and documentation
  6. Scalability
  7. Generalizability
  8. Nonmonetary and cultural perspectives
  9. Affordability, insights, integration with existing environmental assessment
+ A further practical advantage of adapting SCP methods into spatial prioritization of ES capacity is that SCP has already seen wide operationalization in real-life decision-making (Kareksela et al., 2013; Knight et al., 2009; Lehtomäki and Moilanen, 2013; Pressey et al., 2013; Whitehead et al., 2016)⁠. Based on experiences from a broad array of applied projects and the existing literature on the applicability of methods and tools to practice, it is possible to assess the potential of SCP methods in the context of ecosystem services. In the broader context of providing decision-support tools capable of dealing with ecosystem services, there are multiple good reviews available assessing the technical and practical aspects of different software tools (Bagstad et al., 2013; Langemeyer et al., 2016)⁠. However, only few assessments explicitly consider spatial methods and combining multiple ecosystem provision and biodiversity conservation features simultaneously. 
+ In addition to quantifying the differences between the different spatial prioritization methods, we also present the full implementation of the analysis that can be adjusted to other types of data.

### Potential additional analyses/visualizations

1. From Casalegno et al. (2014):
   1. Moran's I for global spatial autocorrelation
   2. Testing spatial covariance between each of the features using the Clifford Richardson Hemon correlation method (CRH) on rank transformed inputs to correct statistical significance for spatial autocorrelation.
